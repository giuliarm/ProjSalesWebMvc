    <strong>The project: </strong>
    <br />
    In this ASP.NET Core project with Entity Framework I use several Object Oriented Programming concepts, with techniques in C#.<br />
     Not forgetting the integration with MySql, witch gave me a strong base(on practice, addiing the studies about) to work with migration and sincronization to relational databases. <br />
     I hope to come back to provide improvements and also get a "pretty face" to him :}<br />
     For now i'm going to study more the framework and aprimore better uses of language.<br />
